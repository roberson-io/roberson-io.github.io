Night drive no headlights
Crossed fingers crossed eyes and tongue tied
Unbuckle floating up to the ceiling
Bright light like a beam we live in

Riding rough through the dirt and dandelions
Crumple up the map it's all just dots and lines
We'll know when we get there
We will feel the magic in the air

Hold your sister's hand she looks so scared
I will have no crying no sniffling from the back seat
Mamma's gonna take you everywhere
Hold each other and tell me that you love me

Each town with a motto
Glad you've arrived so sad when you go
Playing out who we'll end up this time
Practice answering to names that aren't mine

Mamma colors her hair in the bathroom
Angry men come and say they'll knock the door in
We dive out the window
Mamma's shaking when she looks most beautiful

Hold your sister's hand she looks so scared
I will have no crying no sniffling from the back seat
Mamma's gonna take you everywhere
Hold each other and tell me that you love me

Remember remember I took good care of you
Now that you could fly away
But baby bird I could guard your every move
I just know today's the day
RUN

Black strap molasses is my secrets
Sticking to my lungs
Slaps me back for whatever I've done wrong
Breaks my little heart up breaks my little heart

Sad news delivered by my psychic
She's right all day long
What she sees in the crystal
Takes my cash over fist I'll never see a therapist again

Why's it gotta pour when it rains
Oh why's it gotta rain all the time
Why does my mind loop me back
Loop me back to the worst stuff every night
Every ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah

Black belt karate is my conscience
Dodging like the Matrix
But getting spattered and spit on while I duck
Going down with the ship like I promised

I am the maid that doesn't get paid
That doesn't get thanks that doesn't get away
I'm the unsung hero and my hair is falling out
My hair is falling out
My voice is gone from shouting

Ah ah ah

Why's it gotta pour when it rains
Oh why's it gotta rain all the time
Why does my mind loop me back
Loop me back to the worst stuff every night

All my every boo boo every hiccup you kept tabs
Now you want it back

Having flashbacks that smell like teargas
Having flashbacks of the future too
Don't feel so good don't feel so good

Counting my blessings and I'm fairly disappointed
I'd count my angels but they're not in the mood
Don't look so good don't look so good
But I can't look away

Watching your face go through the windshield
Watching the flames kissing the wheel
We turn upside down and don't even notice
A horrible sound

Having worries that you're not gonna make it
Having hopes but they're far more crude
What can I do what can I do

I look around and you're all hurting somewhere
Makes it harder 'cause I'm hurting too
What can I do what can I do
But step into the fire

Watching your face go through the windshield
Watching the flames kissing the wheel
We turn upside down and don't even notice
A horrible sound

Ooh Samuel ah oh

I'm gonna stop guessing how you're feeling
But I know you'll never come to me
We will smash our faces at an impass
Practically we plan to misunderstand each other
We plan to knock out our te e eth

I'm gonna stop trying 'cause you're ruthless
But I know that I was nasty too
Seems like we're both running out of fingers
Basically we're pardoned for all of our wrong doing we're good
As long as no ones looking

You give me reason to believe
You give me reason to believe
I'm nothing special

Underwater I don't want to surface
Finding I feel naked in my skin
Catch your eye and we might think the same thought
All the time we're silent holding the wrong idea
We're free if only we could see

You give me reason to believe
You give me reason to believe
I'm nothing nothing nothing nothing

I'm out of my range I'm out of my waistband
I'm holding my brain and salting with the other hand
Like a slug in the sand inside out with swiss cheese licorice and pickles

I'm scared to be sane I flail in the quicksand
Direct all my blame at loved ones and colleagues who cares
I'm a little off sometimes I'm a shitshow constantly

Hold my phone as I scour this brain alone
I'll come back with answers
The gems were in me already

Scared to be heard I'm scared to get noticed
Although I've been groomed since the womb
I'm shaking in my boots I don't wanna get booed
A woman is polite and pleasant and broken

I'm out of my way I'm lucky or brain dead
Oh what can I say when everything's going to plan
When's it gonna get bad holding my breath so the mold spores don't get in

Hold my phone as I scour this brain alone
I'll come back with answers
The gems were in me already
Hold my phone as I scour this brain alone
I'll come back with all of it sorted
You don't have to worry anymore anymore

Sink your teeth in
Stepped on oxygen
Hold me over hold me over till the morning
Will recover will recover
Sink your teeth in

Maybe meet in person take in my oxygen
Bend me over bend me over till the morning
Sloppy sweaty bodies slink to pieces
Take me to cities
Age with your stories
Pull me over pull me over drink the moment
Sink and swim and fall I'd like to sink my teeth in

Unhinge our future
Rip up the roots of
Tumbleweed and dandelions get the picture

Spread my legs and spread the message rip the roots up

Bright as the first light
Don't wince and don't fight
Hold your gut and spill your guilty on the sidewalk
Pull apart and wipe your mouth and rip the roots up

Ahh ahh ahh
Get so wrapped up show me where I was
Get back to this love
Get back to us
Turn back the clock
Undo my lust
Undo my thoughts
Get back to us
Calling my bluff
Show me I'm love
Show me I'm love

Binging my favorite shows with cake
I slow down with some opiates
So I don't fear the end of days

Spitting out my tooth in Coca-Cola
Lick into the center of a hamburger
I'm trying to find the prize
It's eating me alive

It's my turn to fall apart
Keeping in step with disasters at my feet washed up copper God
Embarrassing
It's my turn to fall apart
Tea bagged by the pendulum swinging
I'm your thrown out lady liberty

Hitching up my dress for firefighters
Grab my ankles investment bankers
Middle of the street
Crown at my feet

Digging through trash for cans and bottles
Found a pretty penny with my old man on it
Lay him down on train tracks
And wipe his face clean

It's my turn to fall apart
Keeping in step with disasters at my feet washed up copper God
Embarrassing
It's my turn to fall apart
Sucker-punched by the pendulum swinging
I'm your thrown out lady liberty

Fill me with pudding
Lie through your teeth
Unbolt my belly to see underneath
I was blown kisses
Before I could speak
I might be froze
But you're colder than me
