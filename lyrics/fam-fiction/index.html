Stings like a hornet in my foot
My own mother couldn't find the words
Stings like a bear mace in my eyes
My own father couldn't get it right

Tv who raised us
We left him outside
Eroded and fried
My mother may I
Be go be outside
Go be outside
Go be out si i ide

Stings like pool water up my nose
She don't know my eyebrow from my toes
Stings like a bumper to a dear
The fear the fear of any of these words
Getting to your ears


Tv who raised us
We left him outside
Eroded and fried
My mother may I be go be outside
Go be outside
Go be out si i ide

But come back
This instant
Come back
Home
Come back
This instant
Come back

TV who raised us
We left him outside
Eroded and fried
TV who raised us
He stayed on my side
Brought bad guys and spies
And kissed me goodni i ight

I can't shake
The anticipation
Of our boy
Getting better

He's right side up
He's half full cup
He's right on time
He's fine he's fine he's fine he's fine

I can't wait
To see the eyes
Of our boy
Fully realized

Oh he can sing
And he won't stop
And such great tales
He's thinking up he's thinking up

Thank God you're not a goner
You're better than you promised
Now this one's gonna take

I hope you're still awake for this
I hope you're still awake

You must wait
You have to patient
My boy
Find your nation

You're right side up
You're half full cup
You're right on time
You're fine you're fine you're fine you're fine

Hey boy
Duck and cover!
That old feeling of hunger
Brings lightning with the thunder
And takes you sweetly under
Well, not on my watch
Not on my watch

Thank God you're not a goner
You're better than you promised
Now this one's gonna take

Thank God we're both awake for this
Thank God we're both awake for this
Thank God we're both awake for this

She takes on too much
She talks about all that's wrong
She has a hole in her back from all the damage she's done

And don't you want to give up
Show 'em who you really are
Just another fallen soldier
Living out a secret war

My mom don't give up
She don't give a fuck
Cancer couldn't eat her
Lung infections can't defeat her
My mom don't give up

These sorts of things seem to run in our blood
People calling feeling sorry, don't pick up

And don't you want to surrender
To the vaster and greater
And don't you want to go
Belly up

My mom don't give up
She don't give a fuck
Cancer couldn't eat her
Lung infections can't defeat her
My mom don't give up

Hold on to your baby hat
I never get to say you're beautiful
Fall out your hair
Blind out your eyes
In a wheelchair
or flying through the sky
You're beautiful
You're beautiful

My mom don't give up
She gives zero

Fucks
Cancer couldn't eat her
Lung infections can't defeat her
My mom don't give up
Mom, don't give up

Fossils in my
Bathtub

Scraping all the
Parasites off
My tongue

Razor burns on
All fours

Cauterize my
Brain it tends to
Wonder

I've got a lot to figure out

You bathed me
You held me
You grew me from a baby
You loved me

You grew me from a baby
You raised me

Charlie cut my hair now my face looks bigger
I'm the only one with a real stake in her
Oh
Why's it so cold in this house
I told you, told you
It's gonna be a better day

Charlie woke me up
She was crying, hitting
Found my little bag
Where our money went
Oh oh
Why's it so cold in this house
I told you, told you
It's gonna be a better day

I know, I know it's cold out there but my
Stomach hurts and people like to stare
I won't leave you alone so much someday

Buddy woke me up he was crying, shaking
Throwing all my clothes in my mother's suitcase
Oh
Why you gotta be so cold right now
I told you, told you
It's gonna be a better day
Buddy held my hair when my waist was bigger
He's the only boy I could take to dinner
We'll be doing fine if we get through winter

I know, I know it's cold out there but my
Buttons all broke and people like to stare
I won't leave you alone so much someday

Someday, we won't need to explain
What our catastrophic hearts ache for
Someday, we won't need to act like we didn't see it coming'
Oh but we didn't see it comin'

I know, I know it's cold out there
I know what people see when they stare
I won't leave you alone so much someday

You spend too long with your head in the shower
I spend too long with my hand down my trousers
Wishing away my demons
Pray for me
Pray for me

You're holding on for dear life to your towel
My knuckles are white from my coward sister
Look away my guardians
Pray for me
Pray for me

Take it easy
Use your inside voice
Go ahead and shout we're all alone
And they already know

You spend too long with your head full of stories
I choose to live in the glory glory
Drinking up the devil
Pray for me
Pray for me

Keep it all in the family
No one has to know
All in the family
Batter up, go!

I bathe in baby's breath
I feel it
Burning out the urges

I breathe in virgin's dresses
I feel it
Purify

Stop looking so terrified
Stop looking so terrified
I am better this time

God I think
I'm sickening
And my skin is
thickening
I need a little more
to get me going like before
I've got a real problem

At night I felt the wind under the door
Snowglobe a monster's snore
My dress got wet
So I'm drying it out
The room moved in so I screamed so loud

A smile
Strongest muscle
Since I've been dragged through the dark
And with
My secret power
I can close my heart

We moved here when the game was rained out
I went to school and I learned to count
I'll never tell how I made my new friend
The woods are enchanted

A smile
Strongest muscle
Since I've been dragged through the dark
And with
My secret power
I can close my heart

Sit here in silence
Bury your violence
In ice and whiskey
It won't hurt a minute
to look down admit it, you're drunk

Hold off the phones
They don't ring and they don't call back

Now sit here in silence
Watch the lizards crawl over your window
Bury your violence
The swirling dips into your dreams

You better stand upright
They're expecting a life-like
Someone who knows why he's here
Though you know better
You don't do impressions of cheer

Singing from the mosque
Makes my heart sore
I don't know a word
But it sounds like
The lord

Daydream of cold days
Pink fingers held over fire
You'll retire
When the children play Carnegie Hall

You've had a minute
To think of your limits
You've had a day
To reflect on your ways
You've two years
Rolling footage of anytime
Someone caught you in headlights

When you're packing for home
And I need a father
Here's hoping you'll show

Singing from the mosque
Makes my heart sore
I don't know a word
But it sounds like
The lord
