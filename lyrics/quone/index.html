by pumpin' out the black tar water

by pumpin' out the black tar water 

I made my friends leave 
with tightrope at the knees

I'm thrown' up the black tar black tar water 

I start to tell it wrong 
by singing' in a song 
when robbers held up guns 
they shootin' out the black tar water 

drippin' off follicles 
seepin' out my pores 
fillin' up my lungs

are you good or are you good enough

I stay up late 
mending shirts and rinsing plates we had out 
for your birthday 
I rub my body against the banister 
and focus my thoughts 
on the subtlety of your snore 

I don't wanna wake 
the household 
I don't wanna shake 
in my morals 

I don't know anymore 
if this body has the same allure 
if your mind drifts off when you close your eyes 
I don't know anymore 
if my constant insisting insisting we shake things up 
has kept your attention 

I rise with the first light 
tuck in my good and whisper it's alright 
to my heart still in dreamland 
I turn the shower all the way cold 
hold in my noises and exercise control 

I don't wanna wake 
the household 
I don't wanna shake 
in my morals 

I don't know anymore 
if my lipstick has the same allure 
if my hair done up catches any eyes 
I don't know anymore 
If my constant insisting demanding we try new things 
has kept your attention

arm propellers crashin' into nothin'

Don't want to slow the chaos yet 
sink like a silver dollar 
in a moment things will all make sense 
forever 

I don't remember which way's upside upside 
I don't remember which way's out 
My thoughts are heavying with doubt
